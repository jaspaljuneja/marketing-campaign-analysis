Problem Statement: Our growth has been stagnant for 2+ years, and we don't know if its due to churning old customers or failing to gain new customers. 

Objective: We will analyse this dataset of 10k records and find out different insights on our data, for ex:
        A) Revenue by each customer
        B) Churn rate of each customer 
        C) New Customer Acquisiton Cost (CAC)
        D) Average order value
        E) Conversion Rate of each customer 

The Stakeholder: The Marketing Manager (who needs to know where to spend the budget).
